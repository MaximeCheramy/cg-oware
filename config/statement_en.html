      Oware, also known as Awal√©, is a turn-based game, where the objective is to capture more seeds than your opponent.
      We're playing the Abapa variant here.

        <p>The game is played turn by turn with two players. Each player controls one side of the board. Each side of
          the board contains 6 <b>houses</b>. The game begins with <const>4</const> seeds in each house.
        </p>
        <p><b>Sowing</b></p>
        <p>
          Players take turns moving the seeds. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six houses under their control.
          The player removes all seeds from that house, and distributes them, dropping <b>one in each house</b>
          counter-clockwise from this house, in a process called <b>sowing</b>. Seeds are not distributed into the house
          drawn from. The starting house is always left empty; if it contained 12 (or more) seeds, it is skipped, and
          the twelfth seed is placed in the next house. </p>
        <p><b>Capturing</b></p>
        <p>
          In Oware Abapa, <b>capturing</b> occurs only when a player brings the count of an opponent's house to <b>two
            or three seeds</b> with the final seed he sowed in that turn. This always captures the seeds in the
          corresponding house, and possibly more: If the previous-to-last seed also brought an opponent's house to two
          or three, these are captured as well, and so on until a house is reached which does not contain two or three
          seeds or does not belong to the opponent.
        </p>
        <p>The captured seeds are removed from play and the player scores that many points.</p>

        <p>
          However, if a move would capture all of an opponent's seeds, the capture is forfeited since this
          would prevent the opponent from continuing the game, and the seeds are instead left on the board.
          <br>
          In fact, one must always make a move that allows the opponent to continue playing. If an opponent's houses are
          all empty, the current player must make a move that gives the opponent seeds. If no such move is possible, the current player
          captures all seeds in his/her own territory, ending the game.
        </p>
